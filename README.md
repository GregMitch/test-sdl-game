# test-sdl-game

Note dir `vendored/SDL` is the actual SDL git repo. So if cloning this repo, you will need to then go clone the contents of https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL into `vendored/SDL`. This could be done better using Git submodules or something but this is just learning for now.

This is template project made by following *Programming Rainbows Beginners Guide to SDL3 in C*.
